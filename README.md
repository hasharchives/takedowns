# HASH Takedown Requests

## Overview

This repository catalogs requests to remove content that HASH has received under its [Government Takedown](https://hash.ai/legal/trust-safety/government-takedown) and [Copyrighted Materials](https://hash.ai/legal/ip/copyright) policies. Our decision to create this repository was inspired by the takedown publication approach of Lumen (formerly Chilling Effects), Google, and GitHub. Within this repository you'll find the text of Government Takedown Notices, DMCA takedown notices and DMCA counter-notices we've received here at HASH in relation to [HASH](https://hash.ai/) and the [Block Protocol Hub](https://blockprotocol.org/hub). We publish these as they are received, with only personally identifiable information redacted.

## Government Takedown Notices

### What are government takedown notices?

From time to time, HASH receives requests from governments to remove content that has been declared unlawful in their local jurisdiction. Although we may not always agree with those laws, we may need to block content if we receive a complete request from a government official so that our users in that jurisdiction may continue to have access to GitHub to collaborate and build software.

### Why do we post government takedown notices? 

We are concerned about Internet censorship, and believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good governance. By posting the notices here, we can better inform the public about what content is being withheld from HASH, and why. We post takedown notices here to document their potential to chill speech.

### What does it mean if a government takedown notice is posted here?

It means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does *not* mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does *not* mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.

## DMCA Notices

### Why do we post copyright notices?

In short, we believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing basis is essential to good governance. Chilling Effects explained it well in 2014 (no longer available online): "We are excited about the new opportunities the Internet offers individuals to express their views . . . but concerned that not everyone feels the same way. Study to date suggests that cease and desist letters often silence Internet users, whether or not their claims have legal merit." (About, ChillingEffects.org, Sept. 2014, licensed under [CC-BY-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/)). Similarly, we post takedown notices here to document their potential to "chill" speech.

### What does it mean if a copyright notice is posted here?

It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does not mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does not mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.
